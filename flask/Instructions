Unlike cookies, 'Session' data are stored on Server.
Session data is stored crpytographically and thus you need to define a secret key for your app.

It is also a dictionary object containing key-value pairs of session variables and associated values.

session['<session-id>'] = <value>

session.pop('<session-id>',None)

We'll demonstrate how a simple login is made persistent using sessions.
